# FaceLamp
An arduino project which lights a lamp when a face is detected in the camera.

## Requirements
- Arduino Uno (or any sword of Arduino board which can be used with pyFirmata)
- 5V relay module
- A lamp (or any electronical device you want to power)

## Setup
Connect your relay controller to the 8th port of your Arduino (Also set 220V connections on your relay). Then, you are all set! Rest is handled by the computer/code!
